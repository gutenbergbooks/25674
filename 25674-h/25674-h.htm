<h2><big>Unidentified Flying Objects and Air Force
Project Blue Book</big></h2>

<p>From 1947 to 1969, the Air Force investigated Unidentified Flying Objects under Project Blue Book.
The project, headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, was terminated Dec. 17, 1969. Of
a total of 12,618 sightings reported to Project Blue Book, 701 remained "unidentified."</p>

<p>The decision to discontinue UFO investigations was based on an evaluation of a report prepared by the
University of Colorado entitled, "<i>Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects</i>;" a review of the
University of Colorado's report by the National Academy of Sciences; previous UFO studies and Air
Force experience investigating UFO reports during the 1940s, '50s and '60s.</p>

<p>As a result of these investigations, studies and experience gained from investigating UFO reports since
1948, the conclusions of Project Blue Book were: (1) no UFO reported, investigated and evaluated by
the Air Force was ever an indication of threat to our national security; (2) there was no evidence
submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that sightings categorized as "unidentified" represented
technological developments or principles beyond the range of modern scientific knowledge; and (3)
there was no evidence that sightings categorized as "unidentified" were extraterrestrial
vehicles.</p>

<p>With the termination of Project Blue Book, the Air Force regulation establishing and controlling the
program for investigating and analyzing UFOs was rescinded. Documentation regarding the former Blue
Book investigation was permanently transferred to the Modern Military Branch, National Archives and
Records Service, Eighth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20408, and is
available for public review and analysis.</p>

<p>Since the termination of Project Blue Book, nothing has occurred that would support a resumption of
UFO investigations by the Air Force. Given the current environment of steadily decreasing defense
budgets, it is unlikely the Air Force would become involved in such a costly project in the foreseeable
future.</p>

<p>There are a number of universities and professional scientific organizations that have considered UFO
phenomena during periodic meetings and seminars. A list of private organizations interested in aerial
phenomena may be found in <i>Gale's Encyclopedia of Associations</i>. Interest in and timely review of UFO
reports by private groups ensures that sound evidence is not overlooked by the scientific community.
Persons wishing to report UFO sightings should be advised to contact local law enforcement agencies.</p>
